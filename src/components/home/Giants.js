          The default distribution of API Platform is a perfectly valid Symfony full-stack
          application that follows <strong>Symfonys&apos;s Best Practices</strong>. It also includes
          the famous Doctrine ORM and all included tools can leverage it. It means that you can:
        </p>
        <HomeList data={data} className="giants__list" />
        <p className="hidden-small">
          However, API Platform is designed as a set of independent and reusable components. You can
          perfectly use them in raw PHP projects or in projects using other frameworks.
